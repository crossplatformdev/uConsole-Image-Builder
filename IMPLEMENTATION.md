# Implementation Summary

## Overview

This implementation adds support for building Debian 13 (trixie) and Ubuntu 22.04 (jammy) uConsole rootfs images using a modular script approach with automated CI/CD.

## Files Added

### Scripts Directory

1. **scripts/build-image.sh**
   - Unified debootstrap-based build script
   - Defaults: SUITE=trixie, ARCH=arm64
   - Accepts OUTDIR as first positional argument
   - Creates base rootfs with minimal packages
   - Supports both Debian trixie and Ubuntu jammy

2. **scripts/setup-trixie-chroot.sh**
   - Debian trixie customization
   - Creates uconsole user with sudo privileges
   - Installs uConsole-recommended packages
   - Leaves kernel installation as separate step

3. **scripts/setup-ubuntu-chroot.sh**
   - Ubuntu 22.04 (jammy) customization
   - Follows original project script style
   - Creates uconsole user with sudo privileges
   - Installs minimal runtime packages
   - Leaves kernel installation as separate step

4. **scripts/README.md**
   - Comprehensive documentation for the new scripts
   - Usage examples for both distributions
   - Requirements and notes

### GitHub Actions Workflow

1. **.github/workflows/build-and-release.yml**
   - Matrix build for both trixie and jammy with arm64 architecture
   - Sets up QEMU for cross-architecture support
   - Runs build-image.sh and corresponding setup script
   - Creates tarball artifacts for each distribution
   - Automatically creates releases with artifacts on push to main
   - Includes workflow_dispatch for manual triggers

### Documentation

1. **README.md** (updated)
   - Documents new modular scripts
   - Quick start guide for both distributions
   - Maintains backward compatibility with original create_image.sh
   - Describes CI/CD capabilities

2. **.gitignore** (updated)
   - Excludes build artifacts (output/, build-output/, rootfs/)
   - Excludes image files (*.img, *.img.xz, *.tar.gz)
   - Excludes build dependencies and temporary files

## Key Features

### Modularity
- Separate scripts for build and customization
- Easy to extend for additional distributions
- Clear separation of concerns

### Cross-Platform Support
- Uses QEMU for cross-architecture builds
- Works on standard amd64 GitHub Actions runners
- Supports arm64 target architecture

### Automation
- Fully automated CI/CD pipeline
- Automatic release creation with artifacts
- Matrix builds for multiple distributions

### Flexibility
- Environment variable configuration (SUITE, ARCH)
- Customizable output directory
- Manual workflow dispatch option

## Default Configuration

- **Default Suite**: trixie (Debian 13)
- **Default Architecture**: arm64
- **Default User**: uconsole (password: uconsole)
- **Sudo**: Passwordless sudo enabled for uconsole user

## Security Considerations

- Scripts run with proper error handling (set -e)
- Validation of SUITE parameter
- Graceful unmounting with error handling (|| true)
- No secrets or sensitive data in repository
- CodeQL security scan passed with no alerts

## Build Process

### For Debian trixie:
```bash
sudo SUITE=trixie ./scripts/build-image.sh output
sudo ./scripts/setup-trixie-chroot.sh output
```

### For Ubuntu jammy:
```bash
sudo SUITE=jammy ./scripts/build-image.sh output
sudo ./scripts/setup-ubuntu-chroot.sh output
```

## CI/CD Workflow

When changes are pushed to main:
1. Two parallel build jobs run (trixie and jammy)
2. Each job creates a rootfs tarball
3. Artifacts are uploaded
4. A release is created with both tarballs

## Testing Performed

- ✅ Bash syntax validation for all scripts
- ✅ YAML syntax validation for GitHub Actions workflow
- ✅ Invalid input handling tested
- ✅ Script headers and permissions verified
- ✅ CodeQL security scan (no alerts)
- ✅ Documentation completeness verified

## Notes

- Kernel installation is intentionally left as a separate step
- The original create_image.sh is preserved for backward compatibility
- GitHub Actions runner requires sudo for debootstrap
- Builds are cross-architecture (amd64 host, arm64 target)

## Future Enhancements

Potential areas for future development:
- Add support for additional architectures (armhf, etc.)
- Add support for more distributions
- Include optional kernel build in workflow
- Add automated testing of rootfs
- Create bootable disk images from rootfs
